### todo

- optimize generation functions
- need canonical highest-res images for all projects and auto-conversion into WebP format
- the only thing structure.yaml does is provide order. that's annoying. take it out, and it's based on the yamls in pages, which is much nicer

### design
- spud is design, the rest is content
- problem is custom pages
